# League of Legends eSports StatTracker
#### Collaborators: Jake Hwang, Michael Hsieh, Perry Yang, Gus Person, Alfred Lam

## Problem:
eSports is a relatively new medium of entertainment; therefore, the resources needed to stay up to date on each team are sparse, making it difficult for users to figure out the teamâ€™s performance against their opponents.

## Solution:
Web-application that displays the statistics of each team and its players in a way that makes it simple for the user to understand how each team is doing.

## Approach:
Using web-scraping on Python (BeautifulSoup), we will grab data from official sources to create visualizations of League of Legends eSports teams and its players.

## Skills/Tools
Python (BeautifulSoup) <-> MySQL <-> Python (Flask library) <-> React.js/HTML/CSS/Javascript

Having skills in MySQL (or any other database implementation), Flask would be great

## Features:
* Search bar for teams, players, and roles
* Display data as table and different kinds of charts
* Team and individual players pages with indepth stats and picture
* Access to the stream (if available)
* and more!
